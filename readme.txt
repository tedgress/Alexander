Wrtrs.net is a social web application built in PHP, Javascript and MySQL.
It is meant for amateur authors to show case their works
to other writers and publishers.

Wrtrs.net is designed to allow for users to upload written work,
follow other users work, send messages between users, create
a user profile with interests, favorite types of literature,
favorite authors, and other related information. 

Some features of its design were not able to be completed
by project deadline.

Build Instructions:

Since wrtrs.net was written in PHP, there was no need for
compliation. The PHP was written in Eclipse and Zend Studio 
and uploaded to the web server. We encourage the examiner to 
browse through the source code as much of the functionality is 
under testing and not evidentin the website runtime.
